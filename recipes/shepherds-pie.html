        <h1>Shepherd's Pie</h1>

        <p>Gather the family round with this quick and easy shepherd's pie recipe. The meat mixture can be made ahead and frozen. You can also substitute<br> 
            instant potatoes for the real thing if you're in a hurry. I especially love to use white cheddar in this recipe!

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add potatoes, and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain, and return<br> 
                to pan.</li>
            <li>While potatoes are boiling, heat oil in a large skillet. Cook ground beef with onion, red pepper, and garlic until beef is evenly brown. Stir<br> 
                in beef broth, ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and curry powder. Bring to a boil, and simmer 3 to 4 minutes. Mix cornstarch with a<br> 
                little water to form a paste, then stir into skillet with tomatoes, peas and carrots. Cook until thickened; season with salt and pepper. Spoon<br> 
                into a casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven on broiler setting. Add milk and butter to cooked potatoes, and whip until smooth and creamy. Spoon over meat mixture. Sprinkle<br>

            <li>Place under broiler for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted and speckled with brown.</li>
